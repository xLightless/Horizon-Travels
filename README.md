Installation process:

- Online version (currently privated)
git clone https://github.com/xLightless/Horizon-Travels.git
pip install -r requirements.txt

- Locally:
1. Locate the drive of the folder (If it is a UWE campus PC make sure to use 'H:' in cmd first).

2. cd /to/project/path

3. cmd /k "python\Scripts\activate.bat"

4. (python3 || py) [-m] main.py

5. Go on your browser and type 'localhost:5000' or '127.0.0.1:5000'

If none of the above work feel free to contact me. The solution above is primarily for Windows.
